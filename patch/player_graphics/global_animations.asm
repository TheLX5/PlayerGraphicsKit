;# Global animations
;# In this place you can put code to globally handle extra movements that aren't
;# handled by the default animation routine and also do not depend on specific powerup
;# numbers.
;# Note that the animations/poses you put here must have valid graphics
;# in each GFX set in order to be properly shown in every possible scenario.
